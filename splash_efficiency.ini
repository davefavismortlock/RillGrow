; Splash efficiency - depth file for RillGrow
;
; The RillGrow model was devised, developed, and programmed by Dave Favis-Mortlock (Environmental Change Institute,
; School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QY, United Kingdom:
; david.favis-mortlock@ouce.ox.ac.uk). 'Rill initiation by overland flow and its role in modelling soil erosion'
; (NERC GR3/11417) provided partial support for developing an early version of RillGrow version.
